## Introduction
Shortest job first (SJF) or shortest job next, is a scheduling policy that selects the waiting process with the smallest execution time to execute next. SJN is a non-preemptive algorithm.

## Implementation
- Sort all the process according to the arrival time.
- Then select that process which has minimum arrival time and minimum Burst time.
- After completion of process make a pool of process which after till the completion of previous process and select that process among the pool which is having minimum Burst time.
