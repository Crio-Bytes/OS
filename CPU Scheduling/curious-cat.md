## Task for curious cats
- Implement each scheduling algorithm in different programming language like Java, C, CPP, Python etc.
- There are some more scheduling algorithms other than these six, you can add thier introduction and implementation steps.
- Find difference between different scheduling algorithms
- Find time and space complexity of each algorithm.
- Think of more advance algorithm and try to implement it.
- Check which scheduling algorithm (/algorithms) your operating system use.
